# Bushfire Assist

Bushfire Assist is a website for providing people who live in bushfire prone regions with information about various measures to be taken before, during and after a bushfire. This application also comprises interactive self-assessment tasks which will enable users to educate themselves and raise awareness.

## Motivation

Residents living in bushfire prone regions frequently express disappointment with the lack of awareness and provision of support during times of bushfire; this disregard is also reflected in the current disaster plans in  Australia which scarcely takes into account the disabled community in times of such events. This is a gap which needs to be addressed in a  way such that all those affected have sufficient awareness of bushfires so that they are able to plan and prepare beforehand thus allowing them to persevere in such challenging times.
